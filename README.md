React TypeScript Tutorial

This was first tutorial that I did with TypeScript and React. And to be honest, I don't think that
TypeScript is hard. I do think there will be a lot of type errors, but TypeScript deals with it and it 
shows you what and where did you mess up.

And for this tutorial, well, it was good. Not the best, but good. I spent more time
fixing Draggable error (which resulted in removing StrictMode, which I am not fan of!).

Still, few more tutorials and then I will install TS into finished project to practice 
switching from React Project to React TypeScript Project.

Onwards to another project!
